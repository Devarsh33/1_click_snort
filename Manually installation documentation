## Required library
  - gcc                     -> GNU Compiler Collections which is used to compile mainly C and C++ language
  - libpcre3-dev            -> support regular expressions whose syntax and semantics are as close as possible to those of the Perl 5 language
  - zlib1g-dev              -> compression library
  - libluajit-5.1-dev       -> contains header files and a statically linkable library for LuaJIT
  - libpcap-dev             -> enables administrators to capture and filter packets
  - openssl                 -> secure communications over computer networks against eavesdropping or need to identify the party at the other end
  - libssl-dev              -> A general purpose cryptography toolkit with TLS implementation (development)
  - libnghttp2-dev          -> implementing the Hypertext Transfer Protocol version 2 (HTTP/2) protocol in C
  - libdumbnet-dev          -> simplified, portable interface to several low-level networking routines
  - bison & flex            -> building programs that handle structured input 
  - libdnet                 -> portable interface to several low-level networking routines
  - autoconf                -> package of M4 macros that produce shell scripts to automatically configure software source code packages
  - libtool                 -> generic library support script that hides the complexity of using shared libraries behind a consistent, portable interface
  
Command:- sudo apt install -y gcc libpcre3-dev zlib1g-dev libluajit-5.1-dev libpcap-dev openssl libssl-dev libnghttp2-dev libdumbnet-dev bison flex libdnet autoconf libtool
